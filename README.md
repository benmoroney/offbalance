## 🎯 Mission
OffBalance aims to disrupt and reset the algorithmic patterns that digital platforms use to predict and influence your behavior. By introducing controlled randomization, we help you break free from filter bubbles and recommendation loops.

## 🛠️ Platform Modules

### 🎵 Spotify (Available Now)
Reset your music recommendations with sophisticated pattern disruption:
- Creates random playlists across genres
- Simulates natural listening patterns
- Switches between different market regions
- Randomizes track attributes and interactions
- Optional preservation of your existing preferences

### 🎥 YouTube (In Development)
Planned features for breaking the video recommendation algorithm:
- Random video watching patterns
- Duration-based interactions
- Comment and like randomization
- Channel subscription cycling
- Watch history manipulation

### 📱 TikTok (Coming Soon)
Strategies for resetting the For You Page:
- View time randomization
- Interest pattern disruption
- Interaction randomization
- Regional content mixing
- Hashtag diversity injection

### 👥 Facebook (Planned)
Approaches to diversify your feed:
- Post interaction randomization
- Friend content prioritization changes
- Group content mixing
- Advertisement preference reset
- Timeline algorithm confusion

### 📸 Instagram (Planned)
Methods to reset the Explore page:
- Story view patterns
- Post interaction randomization
- Hashtag exploration
- Reels algorithm disruption
- Discovery page reset

### 🔍 Google (Under Research)
Techniques for search result depersonalization:
- Search history randomization
- Click pattern disruption
- Location-based result mixing
- Language preference cycling
- Device fingerprint variation

## 🚀 Getting Started
bash

### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/offbalance.git

### Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the desired module
python -m offbalance.spotify # Currently available


## 📊 How It Works

Each platform module operates on three core principles:

1. **Pattern Disruption**
   - Randomized interaction timing
   - Varied content engagement
   - Geographic location mixing

2. **Controlled Chaos**
   - Preserved user preferences (optional)
   - Scheduled randomization
   - Monitored impact

3. **Natural Simulation**
   - Human-like behavior patterns
   - Realistic timing variations
   - Context-aware actions

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security
- No data collection
- Local operation only
- Open source code
- Transparent processes
- API-compliant actions

## 🎮 Control Panel
python

PLATFORMS = {
'spotify': {
'status': 'Available',
'risk_level': 'Low',
'effectiveness': '90%'
},
'youtube': {
'status': 'Development',
'risk_level': 'Medium',
'effectiveness': 'TBD'
},
# More platforms coming soon...
}


## 📈 Impact Metrics
Each module provides:
- Before/After comparisons
- Recommendation diversity scores
- Pattern break effectiveness
- Algorithm reset confirmation
- Content variety metrics
